There are multiple ways to create a Gatling artifact, which will be used by FrontLine to launch a run.
You can use either a build tool (Maven, Sbt, Gradle) or the Gatling bundle.

In this tutorial, we'll use the Gradle build tool, so make sure you have Gradle configured.
You'll use Gradle from the terminal, but you can also do it easily with an IDE like IntelliJ.

## Download the sample Gatling simulation

{{< include download_samples.md >}}

Extract the archive, then navigate to the gradle folder.
This folder contains a basic Gatling simulation which can be used with FrontLine.

## Check the Gradle build configuration

You can check in the `build.gradle` files that this project uses a special `io.gatling.frontline.gradle` plugin to generate the artifact in the proper format.

If you have some existing projects you want to use, you'll have to configure this plugin there too.
If so, please have a look at the [Reference Documentation]({{< ref "../../reference/user/artifact_gen#gradle-project" >}}) for more information.

## Generate the artifact

Open a terminal in the gradle folder and execute the following command to create an artifact:

```console
gradle frontLineJar
```

Gradle will download the necessary dependencies and package your simulation.
That's it, you've created your first Gatling artifact!

## Upload the artifact to FrontLine

### Option 1: Manual Upload

{{< include upload_manual.md "frontline-samples/gradle/build/libs/gradle.jar" >}}

Upload it to FrontLine, either by drag-and-dropping it to the modal, or by clicking on the modal to open the file manager.

You now have to click on the Upload button to upload it to FrontLine.
After a few seconds, the upload will be complete, and your artifact will be ready to use!
