Dedicated IPs allow you to have control over the injectors' IP addresses.
This is useful, for example, if your target system performs some sort of IP address filtering.

The Dedicated IPs table shows your available dedicated IP addresses. Each one belongs to a specific pool.

## Usage

You can enable the use of dedicated IPs when [configuring simulation pools]({{< ref "../simulations#step-3-pools-configuration" >}}).

When starting a run of a simulation configured to use dedicated IPs,
if you have enough dedicated IPs available to satisfy the size of the configured pools,
they will be reserved for the run duration.  If you don’t have enough dedicated IPs available, the run won't start.
