Thanks so much for trying Gatling Cloud. To access Gatling Cloud you can sign up for a free trial plan here or visit https://cloud.gatling.io/ to log in.

To log in, you will need a GitHub account.

If you want to connect with an existing organization, please reach out to a System Admin to [join an organization]({{< ref "../../admin/users#managing-users" >}}).

Pressing the **Continue with GitHub** button will redirect you to GitHub, where you will be asked to authorize the application.

You will need to **authorize** it. We only require access to your public profile and email address.

{{< alert danger >}}
The GitHub authorization page opens in a new tab. If no tab opens, make sure that your browser doesn't block it.

If a System Admin has added you to their organization, should now be logged in.

If you are new to Gatling Cloud, you need to Signup.
